# Tagu-taguan
Tagu-taguan is the traditional Filipino version of the game hide-and-seek. In this classic children's game, one player (the "taya" or seeker) closes their eyes and counts while the other players hide. The seeker then searches for the hiders, and the first one found becomes the new taya.
